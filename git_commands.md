## Recover Deleted Branches

If you have deleted a branch and want to recover it:

1. Use `git reflog` to view recent Git actions:
    ```bash
    git reflog
    ```
2. Find the commit hash for the deleted branch.
3. Recreate the branch using the commit hash:
    ```bash
    git branch <branch-name> <commit-hash>
    ```

### Example:
```bash
git branch recovered-branch abc1234
```

## Branching Best Practices

1. **Use Feature Branches**: Always create a new branch for each task or feature.
2. **Avoid Pushing to `main/dev`**: Use pull requests for merging.
3. **Name Branches Clearly**: Use concise, descriptive names like `feature-login-page` or `fix-auth-bug`.
4. **Review Before Merging**: Ensure code is reviewed and tested.

---

## Real-World Git Workflow

1. Pull the latest code:
    ```bash
    git pull origin dev/main
    ```
2. Create a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    ```
3. Make changes and stage them:
    ```bash
    git add <filename>
    ```
4. Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
    ```
5. Push your branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branchname>
    ```
6. Merge your branch (after review):
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge <branchname>
    ```
